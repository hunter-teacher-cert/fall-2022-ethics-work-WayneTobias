My solution was more complicated than I thought after drawing it out on paper.  
This led me to think that the simpler solution is better even if it might not feel like the most fair application.
I wanted to seat priority customers, then seat groups of any size up to six (the number of seats in a row), and then single seat 
customers as filler between the taken seats.  If there were parties greater than 3, they could be split into the next row but
still remain close to their travel companions.

In the new solution the decision was to limit the accomodation to groups of 2 and seat them next to each other.  A much easier solution
to implement.  The other part of the solution would be to fill seats as the orders came in.  Allow customers the next set of available seats only.
Priority can select the next window or aisle if they desire, but the regular customers are assigned the next single or group that best fits.
